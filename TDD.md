# TDD
test driven development:

- think of a simple feature that you want your code to do
- write a test that checks if that feature works
- run the test and watch it fail (because you havnt written the code yet)
- write the code and make the test pass

## Why do we TDD

 the spec suite indicates the expected behaviour for the piece of code that it tests

 if somebody at a later time changes the code he will be notified when running the tests, if the code doesnt work as initially expected to work
